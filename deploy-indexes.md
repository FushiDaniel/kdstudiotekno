# Firebase Indexes Setup

## Quick Fix (Current Solution)
The app has been updated to use simpler queries that don't require complex indexes. This should work immediately without any additional setup.

## Optional: Deploy Proper Indexes for Better Performance

If you want to use the more efficient server-side sorting (recommended for production), follow these steps:

### Method 1: Use the Firebase Console
1. Click the link in the error message to create the index automatically
2. Or go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/kdstudio-d9676/firestore/indexes

### Method 2: Use Firebase CLI
1. Make sure you have Firebase CLI installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init firestore
   ```

4. Deploy the indexes:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

### Method 3: Manual Index Creation
Go to Firebase Console > Firestore > Indexes and create these composite indexes:

1. **tasks collection**:
   - assignedTo (Ascending) + createdAt (Descending)
   - status (Ascending) + assignedTo (Ascending) + createdAt (Descending)

2. **clockInRecords collection**:
   - userId (Ascending) + clockInTime (Descending)

## Current Status
‚úÖ App works without indexes (using client-side sorting)
‚ö†Ô∏è For better performance with large datasets, deploy the indexes above
üöÄ All functionality is working as expected

The app will continue to work perfectly with the current implementation!
